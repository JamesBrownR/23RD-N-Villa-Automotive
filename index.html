Kofi is a friendly and very patient man who makes it a point to explain what he is doing to fix my car. He even gave me advice to look into my warranty which saved me a bunch of money! My car runs like it is brand new! He has definitely earned my trust and has become my new go-to mechanic. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an honest mechanic."

I called several times and no answer finally I showed up and he gave several excuses as to why he didn't answer. several other people showed up with the same issue of their cars not being repaired correctly and having the same issue after they were charged. This man is a scam artist. Avoid this place at all costs."

Never got a call when it was ready for pick up both times we took it in (for the same issue that STILL is not fixed) Left a message for the manager to call me back 4 days ago and still have yet to receive a phone call. Horrible communication and terrible service. I would never recommend this place to anyone!"
